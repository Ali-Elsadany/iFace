# 🎓 Liveness Face Recognition Attendance App

This Flutter application was developed as part of a **Graduation Project**, focused on modernizing and securing the attendance process using **Liveness Face Recognition** and **Face Detection** technologies.

## 📲 Overview

The app uses advanced **liveness detection** to ensure that a real person is present during the face recognition process — preventing spoofing attempts (e.g., using a photo or video). It's designed for use in both academic and workplace settings, enabling fast and secure attendance logging for:

- 🧑‍🎓 Students  
- 🧑‍💼 Employees

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Liveness Detection** — Verifies that the face is real and live
- 🧠 **Face Recognition** — Identifies users and logs attendance
- ⏱ **Instant Attendance** — Quick and accurate check-in process
- 📊 **User Interface** — Clean and intuitive UI built with Flutter
- 🔒 **Security First** — Prevents spoofing using biometric verification

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Flutter** – Cross-platform mobile development
- **Dart** – Main programming language
- **Camera & ML Packages** – For face detection and liveness recognition

## 🛠 How It Works

1. The user opens the app and chooses the language for the teacher.
2. the student sign up first time only and positions their face within the frame.
3. The app performs **liveness detection** to ensure the person is real.
4. Once verified, the app matches the face with registered users.
5. Attendance is logged automatically.

## 🚀 Getting Started
